# E-Commerce Website Design — Air Jordan (Figma)

🏀 Air Jordan E-Commerce Website Design (Figma Project)

This repository contains the UI/UX design assets and a prototype recording for an Air Jordan themed e-commerce website. The design was created in Figma and exported to this repository as images and a prototype clip for easy review and handoff.

## Overview
- Project: Air Jordan E-Commerce Website Design (Figma)
- Assets: PNG pages (page1.png — page11.png) and `prototype clip.mp4` (prototype recording)
- Design tool: Figma (add link to your Figma project below)

Figma: [Add Figma project link here]

## What is included
- `page1.png` — landing / homepage design
- `page2.png` — product listing
- `page3.png` — product detail
- `page4.png` — cart
- `page5.png` — checkout
- `page6.png` — account / profile
- `page7.png` — responsive/mobile view 1
- `page8.png` — responsive/mobile view 2
- `page9.png` — components & UI kit
- `page10.png` — additional screens
- `page11.png` — final screens
- `prototype clip.mp4` — recorded prototype walkthrough

(If file names differ, open the files in the repo root to confirm.)

## How to preview
- Open any `*.png` file with your image viewer or drag into a browser window.
- Play `prototype clip.mp4` with your system video player.
- Optional: Host a simple static server to browse files. Example using Python 3 (from repo root):

```powershell
# From PowerShell in this repo root
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Suggested README content you can expand
- Project goals and target audience
- Style guide (colors, fonts, spacings)
- Component list (buttons, inputs, cards)
- Responsive breakpoints and behavior
- Handoff notes for developers (assets, export settings, Figma comments)

## Git / push instructions
The repository already has a `.git/` directory. To push these changes to GitHub (your `adil-r120/E-Commerce-Website-Design` repo), run the commands below.

If you already have a remote `origin` configured and it points to the GitHub repo, just push:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\mdadi\Downloads\E-Commerce Website Design"
git add README.md .gitignore
git commit -m "Add README with project overview and .gitignore"
git push origin main
```

If this local repo does not have a remote configured, set it and push:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\mdadi\Downloads\E-Commerce Website Design"
# set remote (HTTPS)
git remote add origin https://github.com/adil-r120/E-Commerce-Website-Design.git
# or set SSH instead if you use SSH keys:
# git remote add origin git@github.com:adil-r120/E-Commerce-Website-Design.git

# Ensure branch is named main and push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Note: Pushing over HTTPS will require a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) if your account uses 2FA; pushing over SSH requires your SSH key to be added to GitHub.

## Next steps I can help with
- Add the real Figma URL and embed images/screenshots inline in README
- Create a `docs/` gallery page that previews the PNGs and prototype
- Improve the README with a style guide and handoff checklist
- If you'd like, I can attempt to finish the rebase and push from this environment (I attempted and hit a conflict which I resolved in this file). If you prefer, you can run the final commands locally.

---

If you want me to continue and finish the rebase/push from here, tell me and I will run the remaining git commands to complete the rebase and push the `main` branch.
