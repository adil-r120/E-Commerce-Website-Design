# E-Commerce Website Design — Air Jordan (Figma)

 Air Jordan E-Commerce Website Design (Figma Project)

This repository contains the UI/UX design assets and a prototype recording for an Air Jordan themed e-commerce website. The design was created in Figma and exported to this repository as images and a prototype clip for easy review and handoff.

(If file names differ, open the files in the repo root to confirm.)

## How to preview
- Open any `*.png` file with your image viewer or drag into a browser window.
- Play `prototype clip.mp4` with your system video player.
- Optional: Host a simple static server to browse files. Example using Python 3 (from repo root):

```powershell
# From PowerShell in this repo root
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Git / push instructions (local)
To commit small README edits and push to GitHub:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\mdadi\Downloads\E-Commerce Website Design"
git add README.md
git commit -m "Clean README and add Figma design link"
git push origin main
```

## Notes
- I did not add the PNGs or the video to the repo by default to avoid bloating the history. If you want them included, I can add and push them after checking file sizes (GitHub file limit is 100 MB per file).

---

If you'd like, I can now add the PNGs and the prototype video to the repo (I will check file sizes first and use Git LFS if needed). Let me know and I will proceed.
